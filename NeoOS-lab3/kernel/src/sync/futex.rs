//! A futex (short for "fast userspace mutex") is a kernel system call that programmers can use to implement basic
//! locking, or as a building block for higher-level locking abstractions such as semaphores and POSIX mutexes or
//! condition variables.
//!
//! See also: https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/basics-of-futexes/
//!
//! A futex consists of a kernelspace wait queue that is attached to an atomic integer in userspace.
//!
//! Before the introduction of futexes, system calls were required for locking and unlocking shared resources
//! (for example semop). System calls are relatively expensive, however, requiring a context switch from userspace
//! to kernel space; as programs became increasingly concurrent, locks started showing up on profiles as a significant
//! percentage of the run time. This is very unfortunate, given that locks accomplish no real work ("business logic")
//! but are only there to guarantee that access to shared resources is safe.
//!
//! The futex proposal is based on a clever observation: in most cases, locks are actually not contended. If a thread
//! comes upon a free lock, locking it can be cheap because most likely no other thread is trying to lock it at the exact
//! same time. So we can get by without a system call, attemping much cheaper atomic operations first. There's a very high
//! chance that the atomic instruction will succeed.
//!
//! However, in the unlikely event that another thread did try to take the lock at the same time, the atomic approach may
//! fail. In this case there are two options. We can busy-loop using the atomic until the lock is cleared; while this is
//! 100% userspace, it can also be extremely wasteful since looping can significantly occupy a core, and the lock can be
//! held for a long time. The alternative is to "sleep" until the lock is free (or at least there's a high chance that
//! it's free); we need the kernel to help with that, and this is where futexes come in (kernel wakes up the sleeper).
//!
//! The implementation is simple. Futex is just a deque holding a bunch of threads (either awake or sleeping) and a Mutex
//! protected counter, and this can be simplified into a Mutex-protected deque. Wake is to pop out each thread from the
//! deque in an FIFO way; wait is to put the current thread into a sleeping status and push it onto the deque. We do not
//! want to block the execution, so we can implement the wait method as a `Future` that returns something asynchronously.
