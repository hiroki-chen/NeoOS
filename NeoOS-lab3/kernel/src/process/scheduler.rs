//! A scheduler is a part of the operating system kernel that manages the allocation of CPU time to various processes and
//! threads. The scheduler ensures that each process and thread receives a fair share of the CPU time, and also determines
//! the order in which processes and threads are executed.
//!
//! For our simple kernel, we choose to design the most popular scheduling algorithm (Round-Robin) and Priority-based one.
